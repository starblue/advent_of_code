Solutions to Advent of Code problems in Rust

## Notes

This is my incomplete collection of solutions starting from 2017.

This is not production code, rather it is relatively quick and hopefully not too dirty code to get the correct result.
In particular:

* There is no error handling, so it will panic on mal-formed input.
* Parsing of the input is not precise, as long as the correct data can be extracted from the input that is fine.

The focus is more on algorithms and using appropriate data structures to get reasonable efficiency.
